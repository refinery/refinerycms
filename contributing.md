## Submitting a new issue ##

If you want to ensure that your issue gets fixed *fast* you should
attempt to reproduce the issue in an isolated example application that
you can share.

## Running tests ##

Always run tests first. Quick start for tests (requires a dummy application) :

    bundle install
    bundle exec rake refinery:testing:dummy_app
    rake
