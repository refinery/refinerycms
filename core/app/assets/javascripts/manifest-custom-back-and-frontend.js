// live editor)  Alternatively, you can add scripts and dependencies to javascripts/manifest-frontend.js which will
// not be included in the admin interface.  manifest-frontend is also useful for dependencies that are already
// included in the manifest-backend but are needed in the fronted of the site / app too.
