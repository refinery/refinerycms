Description:
    Generates a custom plugin for Refinery automatically. It works very similar
    to the Rails scaffold generator.

    A generated plugin gives you all the basic files needed to manage the model
    the plugin will be for.

    The first attribute should always be the one which is the title or name of
    the model.

    There must be at least one attribute.

Additional Supported Field Types

  All field types that are supported by the Rails Scaffold generator are supported with the addition
  of these Refinery specific ones:

  text            - text area with a visual editor
  image           - link to an image picker dialogue
  resource        - link to a resource picker dialogue

Examples:
    rails generate refinery:engine product title:string description:text image:image brochure:resource
    rails generate refinery:engine product title:string description:text image:image brochure:resource --i18n title description
