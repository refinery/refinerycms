Description:
    Generates a custom forms based extension for Refinery automatically.
    It works very similarly to the Refinery Engine generator.

    The first string attribute should always be the one which is the title or
    name field in your model.

    There must be at least one attribute.

Additional Supported Field Types

  All field types that are supported by the Refinery Engine generator are supported
  with the addition of these form specific ones:

  radio           - creates a set of radio buttons based off Model::FIELD_NAMES
  checkbox        - creates a checkbox for true/false values.
  select          - creates a select list with options using Model::FIELD_NAMES

Example:
    rails generate refinery:form job_inquiry name:string message:text job_type:radio brochure:checkbox qualification:select
