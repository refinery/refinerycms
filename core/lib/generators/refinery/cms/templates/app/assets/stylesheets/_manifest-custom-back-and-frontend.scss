/*
 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled and make up the bulk of site.css, which will
 * be included in all frontend views of your site / app.  It will also be compiled into
 * refinery-glass.scss for when frontend views are used for live editing (and they look identical).
 *
 * RELATIVE PATHS
 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,
 * or vendor/assets/stylesheets of plugins, if any, can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * STYLES IN THIS FILE
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the top of the
 * compiled file, but it's generally better to create a new file per style scope.
 *
 * REQUIRE VS IMPORT
 * sass (or scss) is recommended over plain css.  sass' @import is recommended over sprockets require.
 * You can read up about it online.  For example, to include a .scss file here:
 * @import "partials/my-site-styles";
