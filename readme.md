* __[Getting Started](http://refinerycms.com/guides/getting-started)__

## What's it good at?

__Refinery is great for sites where the client needs to be able to update their website themselves__ without being bombarded with anything too complicated.

Unlike other content managers, Refinery is truly __aimed at the end user__ making it easy for them to pick up and make changes themselves.

### For developers

* Easily customise the look to suit the business.
* __Extend with custom extensions__ to do anything Refinery doesn't do out of the box.
* Sticks to __"the Rails way"__ as much as possible; we don't force you to learn new templating languages.
* Uses [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) for fast and concise Javascript.
