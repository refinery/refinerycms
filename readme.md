* __[Getting Started](https://www.refinerycms.com/guides/getting-started)__

For Rails 5.1+ support, you can use version `4.0.x` using this template:

    rails new app_name -m https://www.refinerycms.com/t/4.0.0

For Rails 4.2.x support, you can use version `3.0.x` using this template:

    rails new app_name -m https://www.refinerycms.com/t/3.0.6

You can also install the `edge` version for the latest code using this template:

    rails new app_name -m https://www.refinerycms.com/t/edge

## What's it good at?

__Refinery is great for sites where the client needs to be able to update their website themselves__ without being bombarded with anything too complicated.

Unlike other content managers, Refinery is truly __aimed at the end user__ making it easy for them to pick up and make changes themselves.

### For developers

* Easily customise the look to suit the business.
* __Extend with custom extensions__ to do anything Refinery doesn't do out of the box.
* Sticks to __"the Rails way"__ as much as possible; we don't force you to learn new templating languages.
* Uses [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) for fast and concise Javascript.
