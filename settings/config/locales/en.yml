          yes_make_this_setting_restricted: "Yes, make this setting restricted only to superusers."
          help:
            restricted: This makes the setting only visible and editable by users who are superusers (like you).
            menu_hide_children: Hide any subpages from the menu even if they are present.
            page_title: Very complex options for setting the page title. Here you can set custom CSS class or a different tag or tell it to breadcrumb with pages in its ancestry.
            preferred_image_view: This controls which view the images plugin displays existing images in - grid for 'Grid View' and list for 'List View'. There is a button to automate this process on the images plugin itself.
            show_contact_privacy_link: You can hide or show the link to the privacy policy page on the contact form by the submit button.
            approximate_ascii: "Set this to true if you use Latin characters with accents and other diacritics in page titles. It'll convert characters like ā, č, ž into a, c, z and this way those characters won't appear strangely in the address bar of some web browsers."
            cache_pages_full: Activates the full-page-cache. It allows cached page delivery via Nginx or .htaccess file from Apache.
            use_custom_slugs: A slug is a human-readable ID used to create a page&apos;s full URL, for example &apos;about-us&apos;. To enable the ability to override the slugs that are automatically created by Refinery, set this to true.
