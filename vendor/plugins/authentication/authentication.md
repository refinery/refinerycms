# Authentication

## About

At the heart of Refinery's user management is the authentication plugin located in ``vendor/plugins/authentication``

What this really is is just a standard [RESTFul authentication](http://github.com/technoweenie/restful-authentication) install extended with a few extra features like "I forgot my password" and hooked directly into the heart of Refinery's plugin system.
