## Reporting a Vulnerability

We're very happy to have vulnerabilities reported. 

If possible, it would be great if they could come with a suggested
solution as this will make fixing them easier and faster.

You can email them to `git+security@p.arndt.io` and we will do our best
to fix them as soon as possible.
