h2. How to override a view

The default HTML Refinery generates on the front end is sometimes not suitable for your design. This guide will show you how to:

* Override a front end view in Refinery and replace it with your own version

h3. Overriding your first view

If you want to override one of the views Refinery comes built with (_for example, to add a phone number to the footer_), you'll need to override the view Refinery is providing. Refinery will then use your local version, rather than its original copy.

It's easy to get a copy of this file to modify locally. For example, for the footer, just run in the terminal:

<shell>
$ rake refinery:override view=refinery/_footer.html
</shell>

Or, if you are using an old version of Refinery with a theme installed, try:

<shell>
$ rake refinery:override view=shared/_footer.html theme=mytheme
</shell>

h3. Common Examples

These are files we often override when creating a Refinery site.

<shell>
$ rake refinery:override view=refinery/pages/show
$ rake refinery:override view=refinery/pages/home
$ rake refinery:override view=refinery/_content_page
</shell>

h3. Tips and Tricks

* Trim the '.erb' from the end of the view file name
* Only override when you really need to, as it makes upgrading to future versions of Refinery trickier
* You only need the path to the view from inside the 'views' folder, regardless of which engine the file is in
* This will also work to override views in plugins you've created locally
