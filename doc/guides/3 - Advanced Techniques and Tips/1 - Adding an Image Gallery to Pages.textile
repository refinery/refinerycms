h2. Adding an Image Gallery to Pages

By default pages don't allow you to make galleries of images. This guide will show you how to:

* Use the portfolio extension to display a gallery of images

h3. Introduction

In this guide I will show you how to implement gallery with portfolio plugin in few simple steps. The solution is quick and dirty, but despite that I hope you will find something helpful. This guide assumes that you have already portfolio plugin installed and created a few entries.

h3. Create association between page and portfolio entry

Let say we want every page has exactly one gallery. So for achieve that we are going to add association in page model. Add following code in +/app/models/page.rb+

<erb>
belongs_to :gallery, :class_name => "PortfolioEntry", 
                     :foreign_key => :portfolio_entry_id
</erb>

Next we have to add foreign key attribute to the pages table. Just run following migration:

<ruby>
class AddPortfolioEntrieToPages < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    add_column :pages, :portfolio_entry_id, :integer
  end

  def self.down
    remove_column :pages, :portfolio_entry_id
  end
end
</ruby>

h3. Add select gallery option in page form

First we want to select gallery from list of options (add a few entries in portfolio plugin). Insert this code in +/app/views/admin/pages/_form.html.erb+

<erb>
<div class="field images_field">
  <%= f.label 'Select Gallery' %>
  <%= f.select (:portfolio_entry_id, 
                PortfolioEntry.all.collect { |p| [p.title, p.id.to_s] }, { 
                :prompt   => 'Select gallery', 
                :selected =>  @page.portfolio_entry_id.to_s }, 
                :class    => 'select_gallery' ) %>

  <%= render :partial => 'gallery', 
             :locals => { :f => f, :gallery => @page.gallery } %>
</div>
</erb>

Because we are lazy we are going to use stylesheet from portfolio plugin. Insert below code in +/app/views/admin/pages/_form.html.erb+

<erb>
<% content_for :head do %>
  <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'portfolio' %>
<% end %>
</erb>

Next we have to create partial called gallery in +/app/views/admin/pages/+

<erb>
<div class="gallery_placeholder">
  <ul id='portfolio_images' class='clearfix portfolio_entry_images'>
    <% unless gallery.blank? %>
      <% gallery.images.each do |image| %>
        <li id='image_<%= image.id %>'>
          <%= image_fu image, :grid %>
        </li>
      <% end %>
    <% end %>
  </ul>
</div>
</erb>

Now you should be able to attach image gallery from portfolio to the page. Accessing gallery should be easy as that:

<ruby>
# Retrieve page gallery
@page.gallery
# Retrieve all images from gallery
@page.gallery.images
</ruby>

h3. Add some AJAX magic

For now we could just select gallery from dop down without actually see which images contains. But we want to see images so we will fix that right away. First add this javascript function in the +/public/javascripts/admin.js+ file:

<erb>
init_gallery = function () {
  var gallery_placeholder = $('.gallery_placeholder');
  var portfolio_entry     = $('#page_portfolio_entry_id');
  var error_text          = '<p>Some error message.</p>';

  $('.select_gallery').change(function(e) {
    $('#portfolio_images').remove();

    gallery_placeholder.empty().html('<img 
         src="/images/refinery/ajax-loader.gif" style="padding:10px 0;">');

    $.ajax({
      type: 'GET',
      url: '/refinery/load_gallery',
      dataType: 'xml/html/script/json',
      data: ({id : portfolio_entry.val() }),
      success: function (data) {
        gallery_placeholder.empty();
        $(data).appendTo(gallery_placeholder);
      },
      error: function () {
        gallery_placeholder.empty().append(error_text);
      }
    });
    e.preventDefault();
  });
}
</erb>

and call it in document ready block:

<erb>
$(document).ready(function(){
  init_gallery();
});
</erb>

In above function we call load_gallery action which returns images for selected gallery. So we need to add this action in +/app/controllers/admin/pages_controller.rb+. Lets do it:

<ruby>
def load_gallery
  @portfolio_entry = PortfolioEntry.find(params[:id])
  if request.xhr? and params[:id]
    render 'gallery', :gallery => @portfolio_entry
  else
    render :text => 'No params was sent!'
  end
end
</ruby>

But this would not work until we added below route in +/config/routes.rb+

<ruby>
map.namespace(:admin, :path_prefix => 'refinery') do |admin|
  admin.load_gallery "/load_gallery", :controller => "pages", 
                                      :action => "load_gallery"
end
</ruby>

Now you should be able to bind portfolio entries on every single page and preview images on select action.
