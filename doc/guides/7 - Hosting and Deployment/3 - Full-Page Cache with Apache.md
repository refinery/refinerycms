Full-Page Cache with Apache
---------------------------

If you have a simple Page on a slow Server with Apache you can use the
Full\
Page Caching for deliver the most pages directly from Apache (without
passenger).

endprologue.

### Activate “Cache Pages Full”

Inside *config/initializers/refinery/pages.rb*, find the line that
reads:

<ruby>

1.  config.cache\_pages\_full = false\
    </ruby>

Set it to true, and uncomment the line:

<ruby>\
config.cache\_pages\_full = true\
</ruby>

Then restart your server.

From then on, every page you request from Refinery CMS will be saved at\
public/refinery/cache/pages. For exapmle, after you request\
*http://your-website/about*, you will find a file named\
*public/refinery/cache/pages/about.html* inside your application folder.

### Redirect

Now we have to redirect Apache to these generated files.\
Add the following to your apache config or create an `.htaccess` file in
your project root:

bc.. RewriteEngine On

1.  Rewrite home to check for static\
    RewriteRule \^\$ home

<!-- -->

1.  Checks cache directory for already cached pages\
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST\_URI} \^/\[a-zA-Z0-9\\-/\]\*\$\
    RewriteCond
    %{DOCUMENT\_ROOT}/refinery/cache/pages%{REQUEST\_URI}.html -f\
    RewriteRule \^(\[\^.\]+)\$ refinery/cache/pages/%{REQUEST\_URI}.html
    \[L\]

<!-- -->

1.  By default, Rails appends asset timestamps to all asset paths. This
    allows
2.  you to set a cache-expiration date for the asset far into the
    future\
    ExpiresActive on\
    ExpiresByType image/gif “access plus 1 year”\
    ExpiresByType image/png “access plus 1 year”\
    ExpiresByType image/jpeg “access plus 1 year”\
    ExpiresByType image/x-icon “access plus 1 year”\
    ExpiresByType text/css “access plus 1 year”\
    ExpiresByType application/javascript “access plus 1 year”

<!-- -->

1.  compress static text files\
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/html text/plain text/xml
    text/javascript text/css application/javascript

Now pages are delivered by Apache without touching Passenger.
