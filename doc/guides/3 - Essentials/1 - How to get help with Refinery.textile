h2. How to get help with Refinery

We all sometimes hit a brick wall. This guide will show you how to:

* Get support and help by connecting with other Refinery developers

endprologue.

One of Refinery's key principles is "Encourage and Help Others" so if you have any problems just let us know and we'll do our best to help you. And one day you might help someone else out too!

h3. IRC Channel

Use your favourite IRC client to connect to #refinerycms on freenode.net, or use this "Online IRC Client":http://webchat.freenode.net/?randomnick=1&amp;channels=refinerycms&amp;prompt=1&amp;uio=d4.

NOTE: If you ask a question and don't get an immediate response, don't take offence, just post your question on the "Google Group":http://group.refinerycms.org instead. This gives developers in other timezones a chance to help you out.

Alternatively just use this in-browser client below.
