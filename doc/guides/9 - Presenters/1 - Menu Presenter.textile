h2. Additional Menus

This guide will show you how to:
* configure and use +Refinery::Pages::MenuPresenter+
* use a decorator to add custom functionality to +Refinery::Page+ class
* override Refinery's view

endprologue.

h3. Requirements

Let's start with requirements. I tried to bring them together in the follwoing steps:

* We need to add an additional navigation menu in the footer section of each page right above Refinery's copyright notice.
* Admin should be able to specify which pages appear in the footer menu, so we also need to add a checkbox under "Advanced options" in the page edit form.
* Data about whether page shows up in the footer should be persisted to the database.

Alright, it's time to dive deep into the code.

h3. Adding a +show_in_footer+ column to the +refinery_pages+ database table

The requirement was to persist the data to the database, so we will start by creating a migration that a will add +show_in_footer+ column to the +refinery_pages+ database table. Open up terminal and type:

<shell>
rails generate migration add_show_in_footer_to_refinery_pages
</shell>

This will generate an empty migration. Open it and add the following code:

<ruby>
class AddShowInFooterToRefineryPages < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    add_column :refinery_pages, :show_in_footer, :boolean, :default => false
  end
end
</ruby>

h3. Decorating the Refinery::Page model

Before overriding Refinery's form view, we want to decorate the +Refinery::Page+ class. Create a file +app/decorators/models/refinery/page_decorator.rb+ with this content:

<ruby>
Refinery::Page.class_eval do
  attr_accessible :show_in_footer

  def self.footer_menu_pages
    where :show_in_footer => true
  end
end
</ruby>

We added +show_in_footer+ to the allowed attributes list so that it doesn't raise a mass-assignment error each time someone tries to save the page. We also added +footer_menu_pages+ class method to abstract away ActiveRecord query method.

h3. Overriding the form view

As I previously mentioned, let's make it so that a "Show in footer" checkbox appears right after Admin expands the "Advanced options" when editing a page. To do this, we have to override the file [_form_advaned_options.html.erb partial](https://github.com/refinery/refinerycms/blob/2-1-stable/pages/app/views/refinery/admin/pages/_form_advanced_options.html.erb). Type this in the terminal:

<shell>
rake refinery:override view=refinery/admin/pages/_form_advanced_options.html
</shell>

Now open the +_form_advanced_options.html.erb+ partial and add the following code right after the h2 HTML tag:

<html>
<div class='field'>
  <span class='label_with_help'>
    <%= f.label :show_in_footer, "Show in footer" %>
  </span>
  <%= f.check_box :show_in_footer %> Show this page in the footer menu
</div>
</html>

The end result should look like this:

h3. Creating and configuring the Presenter

Now let's focus on the presenter itself. Once instantiated, it is also possible to configure its CSS/HTML using this instance. We will use a Rails helper to instantiate a new instance of +Refinery::Pages::MenuPresenter+ and also configure it there. We're taking this approach because we don't want to pollute the view with configuration code.

Open the ApplicationHelper and add this code:

<ruby>
def footer_menu
  menu_items = Refinery::Menu.new(Refinery::Page.footer_menu_pages)

  presenter = Refinery::Pages::MenuPresenter.new(menu_items, self)
  presenter.dom_id = "footer_menu"
  presenter.css = "footer_menu"
  presenter.menu_tag = :div
  presenter
end
</ruby>

We create an instance of +Refinery::Menu+ by passing a collection of footer pages (+Refinery::Page.footer_menu_pages+) to it. We need it because it will be the data that will be "presented" by +Refinery::Pages::MenuPresenter+. We assign this instance to a variable called +presenter+ in order to configure this presenter. I want my footer menu to be wrapped inside of a +div+ tag instead of the default +nav+ tag and I also want it to have a CSS class and an ID of +footer_menu+ instead of the default +menu+ one:

<ruby>
presenter.dom_id = "footer_menu"
presenter.css = "footer_menu"
presenter.menu_tag = :div
</ruby>

Now that we have configured the menu presenter we need to return it because we'll have to call +.to_html+ on it in the view later on.

h3. Rendering the Menu in the View

Requirement was for the footer menu to appear just above Refinery's copyright notice. To do that we will simply override Refinery's footer view:

<shell>
rake refinery:override view=refinery/_footer.html
</shell>

Next, add this code in the footer partial, above the existing code:

<erb>
<%= footer_menu.to_html %>
</erb>

h3. Taking a look at it

Now it's time to take a look at how everything is working. Edit a couple of pages and for some of them check the "Show in footer" checkbox located under "Advanced options". Now go to the root url of your site and take a look at the bottom; you should see links for the pages for which you checked the "Show in footer" checkbox. Also here's how the generated HTML should look:

<html>
<div class="footer_menu" id="footer_menu">
  <ul>
    ...
 </ul>
</div>
</html>
