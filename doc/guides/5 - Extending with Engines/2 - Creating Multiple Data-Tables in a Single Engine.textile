h2. Creating Multiple Data-Tables in a Single Engine

This guide will show you how to:

* Creating multiple tables on one single extension

endprologue.

WARNING: This only works on Refinery versions 0.9.9 and greater


h4. Generating an extension

Refinery ships with an extension generator that makes adding your own functionality a breeze. It works just like the Rails scaffold generator.

<shell>
$ rails generate refinery_extension singular_model_name attribute:type [attribute:type ...]
</shell>

TIP: to see all the options supported by the +refinery_extension+ generator just run +rails g refinery_extension+

Here is a list of the different field types are what they give you:

|*field type*|*description*|
|text|a multiline visual editor|
|resource|a link which pops open a dialog which allows the user to select an existing file or upload a new one|
|image|a link which pops open a dialog which allows the  user to select an existing image or upload a new one|
|string and integer|a standard single line text input|

If you remember, we told Rick that we'll give him an area to post up events he'll be at. Although he could technically create a new page in Refinery to add this content there, areas that have special functionality are much better suited as an extension.

Rick is going to want to enter the following information about each event:

* The event title
* The event date
* A photo
* A little blurb about the event.

Run this command to generate the events extension for Rick[1]:

<shell>
$ rails generate refinery_extension event title:string date:datetime photo:image blurb:text
      create  vendor/extensions/events/app/controllers/admin/events_controller.rb
      create  vendor/extensions/events/app/controllers/events_controller.rb
      create  vendor/extensions/events/app/models/event.rb
      create  vendor/extensions/events/app/views/admin/events/_form.html.erb
      create  vendor/extensions/events/app/views/admin/events/_event.html.erb
      create  vendor/extensions/events/app/views/admin/events/_sortable_list.html.erb
      create  vendor/extensions/events/app/views/admin/events/edit.html.erb
      create  vendor/extensions/events/app/views/admin/events/index.html.erb
      create  vendor/extensions/events/app/views/admin/events/new.html.erb
      create  vendor/extensions/events/app/views/events/index.html.erb
      create  vendor/extensions/events/app/views/events/show.html.erb
      create  vendor/extensions/events/config/locales/en.yml
      create  vendor/extensions/events/config/locales/lolcat.yml
      create  vendor/extensions/events/config/locales/nb.yml
      create  vendor/extensions/events/config/locales/nl.yml
      create  vendor/extensions/events/config/routes.rb
      create  vendor/extensions/events/db/migrate/create_events.rb
      create  vendor/extensions/events/db/seeds/events.rb
      create  vendor/extensions/events/features/manage_events.feature
      create  vendor/extensions/events/features/step_definitions/event_steps.rb
      create  vendor/extensions/events/features/support/paths.rb
      create  vendor/extensions/events/lib/generators/refinerycms_events_generator.rb
      create  vendor/extensions/events/lib/events.rb
      create  vendor/extensions/events/lib/tasks/events.rake
      create  vendor/extensions/events/public/.gitkeep
      create  vendor/extensions/events/readme.md
      create  vendor/extensions/events/refinerycms-events.gemspec
------------------------
Now run:
bundle install
rails generate refinerycms_events
rake db:migrate
------------------------
</shell>

As the output shows next run:

<shell>
$ bundle install
$ rails generate refinerycms_events
$ rake db:migrate
</shell>

A +refinerycms_events+ generator is created for you to install the migration to create the events table. Run all the commands provided by in the terminal.

TIP: When new extensions are added it's a good idea to restart your server for new changes to be loaded in.

As you can see inside your text editor, in vendor/extensions folder, the event extension is in stored. this is where all your files including your migration file will be in placed. Similar like a normal Rails app looks like. 

Ok. Once you have generate an extension. It's time to create another table to put inside the extension. 

To do that, run this command. Notice the last argument(+extension_name:extension+). This is where your new table will be inserted to. 

<shell>
$ rails g refinery_extension place name:string events:extension
	  create  vendor/extensions/events/app/controllers/admin/places_controller.rb
      create  vendor/extensions/events/app/controllers/places_controller.rb
      create  vendor/extensions/events/app/models/place.rb
      create  vendor/extensions/events/app/views/admin/places/_actions.html.erb
      create  vendor/extensions/events/app/views/admin/places/_form.html.erb
      create  vendor/extensions/events/app/views/admin/places/_states.html.erb
      create  vendor/extensions/events/app/views/admin/places/_records.html.erb
      create  vendor/extensions/events/app/views/admin/places/_place.html.erb
      create  vendor/extensions/events/app/views/admin/places/_sortable_list.html.erb
      create  vendor/extensions/events/app/views/admin/places/edit.html.erb
      create  vendor/extensions/events/app/views/admin/places/index.html.erb
      create  vendor/extensions/events/app/views/admin/places/new.html.erb
      create  vendor/extensions/events/app/views/places/index.html.erb
      create  vendor/extensions/events/app/views/places/show.html.erb
      create  vendor/extensions/events/config/locales/tmp/en.yml
      create  vendor/extensions/events/config/locales/tmp/fr.yml
      create  vendor/extensions/events/config/locales/tmp/lolcat.yml
      create  vendor/extensions/events/config/locales/tmp/nb.yml
      create  vendor/extensions/events/config/locales/tmp/nl.yml
      create  vendor/extensions/events/config/tmp/routes.rb
      create  vendor/extensions/events/db/migrate/create_places.rb
      create  vendor/extensions/events/db/seeds/places.rb
      create  vendor/extensions/events/features/manage_places.feature
      create  vendor/extensions/events/features/step_definitions/place_steps.rb
      create  vendor/extensions/events/features/support/tmp/paths.rb
      create  vendor/extensions/events/lib/generators/refinerycms_places_generator.rb
      create  vendor/extensions/events/lib/refinerycms-places.rb
      create  vendor/extensions/events/lib/tasks/places.rake
      create  vendor/extensions/events/refinerycms-places.gemspec
      create  vendor/extensions/events/spec/models/place_spec.rb
      append  vendor/extensions/events/lib/refinerycms-events.rb
------------------------
Now run:
bundle install
rails generate refinerycms_events places
rake db:migrate
------------------------
</shell>

Run all the command provided like the above. Notice +rails generate refinerycms_events places+. This is where it will all took place for your new migration file. 

The bundle install command will run the normal rails bundle install.

The +rails generate refinerycms_events places+ will run and create the migration file with timestamp. Example:

<shell>
$ rails generate refinerycms_events places

You already have a migration called create_events
      create  db/migrate/20110608043313_create_places.rb
   identical  db/seeds/events.rb
      create  db/seeds/places.rb
------------------------
Now run:
rake db:migrate
------------------------
</shell>

Lastly, run rake db:migrate as usual.
