h2. Tabbed fields in your engine's admin area

Sometimes you create an engine with a number of wymeditor fields. Having these display one after another can be overwhelming for your clients (or you!).
This guide will show you how to:

* Organise many visual editors into nice tabs like Refinery's 'pages' engine does

WARNING: This only works on Refinery versions 0.9.9 and greater

h3. Changing your admin view to support multiple tabs

If your engine has a number of text areas that you'd like to display as a series of tabs instead, simply edit the admin view (under +app/views/admin/engine_name/_form.html.erb+), and add:

<erb>
<%= render :partial => "/shared/admin/tabbed_fields",
           :locals => { :f => f,
                        :tabbed_fields => [:field, :list] } %>
</erb>

Replace the array +[:field, :list]+ with an array of symbols of the columns you would like displayed as tabs.
