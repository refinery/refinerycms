WARNING: This tutorial is only for advanced Refinery users who are used to continuous integration with Refinery. This will overwrite files so make sure you have a backup or have your current code committed to a remote git repository.

Here are the basic steps:

h3. Clone Refinery

First clone the git source in order to get the newest app generator.

<shell>
$ git clone git://github.com/refinery/refinerycms.git ~/refinerycms-edge
</shell>

h3. Upgrade your current application

Replace the line that looks like this:

<ruby>
gem 'refinerycms'
</ruby>

With a line that looks like this:

<ruby>
gem 'refinerycms', :path => '~/refinerycms-edge'
</ruby>

Now use the refinerycms generator to update your application:

<shell>
$ bundle exec rails generate refinery:cms --update
</shell>

h3. Solve any deprecation problems.

Look at your log when running you app to make sure nothing has been deprecated. If there are some, fix the issues.
