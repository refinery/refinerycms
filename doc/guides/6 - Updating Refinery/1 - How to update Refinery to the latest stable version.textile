WARNING. Check out this post "http://www.refinerycms.com/blog/whats-new-in-refinery-cms-099":http://www.refinerycms.com/blog/whats-new-in-refinery-cms-099 to see how to upgrade to 0.9.9 from 0.9.8.9. You can't update from 0.9.8.9 to anything later than 0.9.9 without going to 0.9.9 first.

h3. Introduction

First you need a current installation of Refinery. Refinery would have been installed by one of two ways, Ruby Gem or Git. When updating, the latest files are copied into your project.

h3. Updating a Gem Installation of Refinery

Take a look at "http://rubygems.org/gems/refinerycms":http://rubygems.org/gems/refinerycms to find the latest version number for Refinery.

Edit your +Gemfile+ to reference the latest version of Refinery (a later version than the one shown "may exist":https://rubygems.org/gems/refinerycms/versions).

<ruby>
gem 'refinerycms', '= 0.9.9.21'
</ruby>

Now install the new gems using bundler ('bundle install' is outdated):

<shell>
$ bundle update
</shell>

Use the rails generator to update your Refinery installation:

<shell>
$ rails generate refinerycms --update
</shell>

Database migrations and new gem dependencies may have been added, so finish your Refinery update with:

<shell>
$ rake db:migrate
$ bundle install
</shell>
