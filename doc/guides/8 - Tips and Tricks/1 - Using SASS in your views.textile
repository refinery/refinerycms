h2. Using SASS in your views

Some developers prefer to use "SASS":http://sass-lang.com/ to generate their CSS. This guide will show you how to:

* Setup and use SASS instead of CSS

To use sass templates with your theme you just need to add the location of your theme to the SASS plugin configuration.

First make sure that you have the SASS gem installed by adding it to your gemfile:

<ruby>
gem 'sass'
</ruby>

Then run:

<ruby>
bundle install
</ruby>

Next create the +sass+ directory within your theme’s stylesheets directory, usually in:

<ruby>
Rails.root.join('public/stylesheets')
</ruby>

In your +config/application.rb+ or +config/environment.rb+ add this line:

<ruby>
Sass::Plugin.add_template_location(
  Rails.root.join('public/stylesheets/sass').to_s,
  Rails.root.join('public/stylesheets').to_s
)
</ruby>

NOTE: This works with version 3.0.6 of HAML. The method +add_template_location+ is fairly new and didn’t exist in older versions.
