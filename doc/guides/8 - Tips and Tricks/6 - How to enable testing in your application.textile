h2. How to enable testing in your application

Refinery ships with a range of specs and cucumbers to test it. This guide will show you how to:

* Run the tests that come built in with Refinery to ensure your install is working correctly
* Run the engines tests

endprologue.

h3. Setup test enviroment

At the Gemfile uncomment the refinerycms-testing line

<shell>
  gem 'refinerycms-testing'
</shell>

And run

<shell>
$ bundle install
</shell>

Now we will configure our test enviroment with

<shell>
$ rails generate refinerycms_testing
<shell>


h3. Running the Tests

At your application root run:

<shell>
$ bundle exec rake
</shell>

This will run the cucumber and rspec tests.

To run just cucumber:

<shell>
$ bundle exec cucumber
</shell>

To run just rspec:

<shell>
$ bundle exec rake spec
</shell>

h3. Where are the tests?

Refinery tests are located inside each engine in two locations: +/features+ and +/spec+.

Third-party engines should have their own tests in their respective engine folders (which may be inside their gem).
