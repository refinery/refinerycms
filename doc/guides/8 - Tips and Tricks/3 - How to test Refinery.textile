h2. How to test Refinery

Refinery ships with a range of specs and cucumbers to test it. This guide will show you how to:

* Run the tests that come built in with Refinery to ensure your install is working correctly

endprologue.


h3. Running the Tests

At your application root run:

<shell>
$ rake
</shell>

This will run the cucumber and rspec tests.

To run just cucumber:

<shell>
$ rake cucumber
</shell>

To run just rspec:

<shell>
$ rake spec
</shell>

h3. What do I do if tests fail?

Check the error message to see if it is a problem on your end.

If not, then "file an issue on GitHub":https://github.com/resolve/refinerycms/issues, with your version of Ruby and OS included. Bonus points if you fix it yourself!

h3. Where are the tests?

Refinery tests are located inside each engine in two locations: +/features+ and +/spec+.

Third-party engines should have their own tests in their respective engine folders (which may be inside their gem).
