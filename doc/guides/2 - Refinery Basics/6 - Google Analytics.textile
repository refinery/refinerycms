h2. Google Analytics

Google Analytics is a great free way to find out how much traffic your site is getting. This guide will show you how to:

Default Refinery layouts have Google Analytics support built in. To start using Google Analytics on your site, all you need to do is edit +config/initializers/refinery/core.rb+.

Uncomment and edit @config.google_analytics_page_code@.

By default, the Analytics code will only be rendered in the layout in production, and if you are not logged into Refinery.
