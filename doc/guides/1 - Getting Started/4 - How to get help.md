# How to get help

We all sometimes hit a brick wall. This guide will show you how to:

* Get support and help by connecting with other Refinery developers

One of Refinery's key principles is "Encourage and Help Others" so if you have any problems just let us know and we'll do our best to help you. And one day you might help someone else out too!

## Gitter Channel

Connect to our [Refinery Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/refinery/refinerycms).

If you ask a question and don't get an immediate response, don't take offence; either wait a half-hour and ask again, or just post your question on the [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/refinery-cms) instead. This gives developers who are in other timezones or who are temporarily unavailable a chance to help you out.

Please remember that Refinery is a fully open-source application. None of us are paid to fix it or improve it; we do so because we like Refinery and we greatly appreciate its value. Unfortunately, we cannot immediately drop everything to solve a problem for you (as much as we'd like to). Be patient, and try to figure out the problem on your own while you wait. The more information you can dig up yourself, the easier it is for us to help you resolve your issues expediently.

## Google Group

The [Refinery CMS Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/refinery-cms) is a great place to ask for help if you don't get a response on Gitter. Your first message may take a short while to appear, as all first-time posters are required by Google Groups to pass moderation.
