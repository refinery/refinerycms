# Resources (Files)

## About

The Resources plugin allows you to upload files such as PDFs and other files you want your users to download.

## How it works

The resources plugin uses [dragonfly](http://github.com/markevans/dragonfly) to handle the storage of files.
This plugin is mainly comprised of the [Crudfiy mixin](http://github.com/resolve/refinerycms/blob/master/vendor/plugins/refinery/crud.md).
