## About

Refinery's dashboard is a plugin that does two simple things

* Reports recent activity on all the core and custom plugins
* Provides convenient links to common tasks.

## How do I Hook my Custom Plugin into the Recent Activity log?

Read ["Getting your Plugin to Report Activity in the Dashboard"](http://github.com/resolve/refinerycms/blob/master/vendor/plugins/refinery/plugins.md) in the Plugin documentation.

### "Activity Show Limit"

This allows you to specify how many items should show up in your recent activity list.

Example: if we set the activity show limit to 5, only 5 items will show in the recent activity.
